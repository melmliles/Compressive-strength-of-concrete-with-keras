# Compressive-strength-of-concrete-with-keras

1. Topic:

In this project, we will build a regression model using the Keras library to model the concrete compressive strength.

2. Concrete Data:

The data can be found here: https://cocl.us/concrete_data. To recap, the predictors in the data of concrete strength include:

Cement

Blast Furnace Slag

Fly Ash

Water

Superplasticizer

Coarse Aggregate

Fine Aggregate
